			<p>At Retain, we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our note-taking application.</p>

			<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
			<p>Retain is designed with privacy in mind. All your notes and data are stored locally on your device. We do not collect, transmit, or store any of your personal information, notes, or data on our servers.</p>

			<h2>Local Storage</h2>
			<p>All notes, including titles, content, color tags, and timestamps, are stored exclusively on your device using local storage. This means:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Your notes are never sent to external servers</li>
				<li>Your data remains private and under your control</li>
				<li>We have no access to your notes or personal information</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Permissions</h2>
			<p>Retain requires minimal permissions to function:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Internet permission: Required for React Native framework functionality only</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We do not use your internet connection to transmit any of your data.</p>

			<h2>Data Security</h2>
			<p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, the security of your notes depends on the security of your device. We recommend:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Using device lock screen protection (PIN, password, or biometric)</li>
				<li>Keeping your device's operating system updated</li>
				<li>Being cautious when sharing your device with others</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
			<p>Retain does not integrate with any third-party services that would access your notes or personal data. We do not use analytics services, advertising networks, or any other services that would collect your information.</p>

			<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
			<p>Retain is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children. Since we do not collect any information, this is not applicable, but we want to make our policy clear.</p>

			<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
			<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in this document with an updated "Last updated" date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.</p>

			<h2>Your Rights</h2>
			<p>Since all your data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control over your notes. You can:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>View, edit, or delete any note at any time</li>
				<li>Uninstall the app, which will remove all stored data (subject to your device's app data retention policies)</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Contact Us</h2>
			<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us through the Google Play Store listing or your preferred method of communication.</p>

			<p class="italic">By using Retain, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use the application.</p>
